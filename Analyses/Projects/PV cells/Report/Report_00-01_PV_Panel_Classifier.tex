\section{Problem Description}

This work developed a system for automatically identifying cracks in PV panels from their 2D grayscale computed tomography images. A sample of five images in shown in Figure \ref{fig:sample_panels}.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sample_panels.pdf}
\caption{Scans of the PV panels that were analyzed for damage. The first, third, fourth, and fifth panels from the left contain cracks. Pock-marks similar to those seen on the first panel were not regarded as cracks.}
\label{fig:sample_panels}
\end{figure}
50 images were provided, of which 38 were deemed to be cracked. The median frame height for these images was 965 pixels; their width was similar.

 The criteria for labelling a given mark as a crack were as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A dark line propagating diagonally for at least 50 pixels
	\item Was no more than 15 pixels in width (transverse to crack axis, see Figure \ref{fig:crack_width}
\end{itemize}
As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:crack_v_scratch}, it was sometimes difficult to ascertain whether a given mark was a crack or a scratch. For the purposes of this work, the latter were considered to be fainter and wigglier - heuristic measures in the absence of any conveniently quantifiable differences. The labels themselves consisted of manually drawn binary masks, an example of which is shown in Figure \ref{fig:mask_example}. Each pixel in a mask was in effect indicators representing whether the associated image pixel was part of a crack. To mitigate the poor localization performance of certain filters at the processing stage, cracked areas were labelled generously. The masks were validated by a panel inspector.
